                                    <p>The Extended Essay is an opportunity for you to conduct independent research in an area of personal interest, providing you with a chance to work in the same way as a university student.  It demonstrates both knowledge and skills, involving:</p>
                                    <ul>
										<li>	Self-discipline & a systematic approach</li>
										<li>	Creative & critical thinking skills</li>
										<li>	Research skills</li>
										<li>	Communication & presentation skills</li>
									</ul>
                                    <p>It is a compulsory element in the IB diploma program, and failure to produce an EE or submitting a very weak one would mean the diploma is not awarded.  However, a good EE can help to earn you an additional 3 points on top of the points you get from your exam results.  You should also be aware that if you are asked to attend an interview for university, the EE is often a topic for discussion.</p>

                                       Since the EE is not formally taught and this is a component where you are responsible for your own learning, it is easy to allow this to slip down your list of priorities. The school has established a series of interim deadlines to help you walking through the process. It is important that all deadlines are met. The ultimate consequence of missing deadlines is likely to be a lower overall IB grade when you apply for university.

Don’t get “stuck” and then fall behind. Be proactive and ask for help.
Note: English B students should follow the schedule that has been provided to you by the EB department. The EB deadlines supersede the school deadlines.</p>

                                        <li>The EE is a RESEARCH paper, so your essay relies heavily upon quality research. You will need both primary and secondary research. Ask your supervisor about the difference between the two.</li>
                                        <li>Think of your research like an iceberg. About 80% of an iceberg is not seen as it lies below the water-line. However that huge mass below is what allows a great deal to be sticking up above the water. In the same way your essay will need to ‘float’ on a mass of research, which is not explicitly visible in the essay.</li>
                                        <li>The point of your research will depend on the subject and topic you have chosen.
e.g. Mathematics and experiment-based science topics may need less secondary research than Group 3 topics.
</li>
                                        <li>Your research should seek to provide you with a depth and range of knowledge so that you:

                                        <li>You must have completed all your research and/or data gathering before the “Extended Essay Days” (24-26 June).</li>

Bottom line – use academic research engines.</li>
                                        <li>Tip: If you scroll to the bottom of a Wikipedia article, you’ll find a list of sources that were used to write the article. Seek out these original sources as a starting point. You may find them in a Google search or on JSTOR or Questia School.</li>

                                        <li>From the start keep a record of the websites, books, magazines and journals you have consulted, including the page numbers.

For websites, you’ll also need to note the date you accessed the site. You should also keep track of these cites in your Research Journal.</li>
                                        <li>Some subjects require you to keep a Research Journal. This is a place where you keep all research information, reflections, analysis, and questions that arise while researching.</li>

                                        <li>The Abstract is an overview of your essay that goes immediately after your title page and before your Table of Contents page.  The idea is that someone who wants to check if your paper is relevant to their research, but doesn’t have time to read it all, can see the outline of your enquiry.  It must contain 1) your research question, 2) an explanation of the scope of your investigation, and 3) a summary of your conclusion. For example: This abstract was submitted as part of an essay in 2003: (Is this a good example???)</li>

                                            This investigation attempts to answer the question “What were the causes of the Arab-Israeli War of 1948-1949 and could the war have been prevented?”  In the research process, background research was first obtained which led to a working thesis which limited the scope of the investigation to the Arabs, Jews, British and the UN.  Many sources were then explored for further information, including books, periodicals and newspapers.  However, it was much easier to find Jewish authors than Arab authors.  The first chapter introduces the conflict between the Arabs and the state of Israel.  In the main body of the paper, the causes of the war are split up into four different areas: Arab resentment of the Jews, British politics in the Middle East, UN plans for Palestine, and Jewish actions in Palestine.  The importance of causes of the war within each of these four areas is examined.  In the final chapter, the most important causes are examined in terms of their relative importance, and the question of whether or not the war could have been prevented is addressed.   The conclusion is that the war could have been more easily prevented during World War 1 than in the late 1940s, and that British politics were the most important cause of the war.

                                        NB  The abstract is not an introduction or an outline of your overall ideas.
For the IB EE, the Abstract must not exceed 300 words. Your supervisor will show some samples of an abstract that are appropriate to your subject area.

                                        <li>Research Question (RQ) – This is the question that your paper sets out to answer; and a sharply focused question is best.  In some subjects it can be a hypothesis to test. A broad topic or question is not usually successful. 
<br />Note: Subjects have very specific requirements/categories for the RQ, so familiarize yourself with this.
</li>
                                        <li>Table of Contents  – This should follow the documentation style (e.g. MLA) that you are using for your entire paper. The Table of Contents must include any headings, subheadings and appendices that you used and the corresponding page numbers. The TOC occurs after the abstract and before the introduction. The abstract should NOT be mentioned in the TOC.</li>
                                        <li>Introduction – The IB EE has specific requirements for the introduction. The introduction should be brief. Your essay should explain why your topic is worthy of study / why it is a valid enquiry. In other words, what makes it worthy of investigation? You should also aim to put your research into some form of academic context and show how your essay relates to existing knowledge on the topic.   You must state your RQ clearly in the introduction.  If you have narrowed the topic to make it manageable within the word limit, this should also be explained.<br /> 

Note: Each subject may have specific requirements for the introduction, so be sure to read the subject specific guidelines found in the IB EE guidebook.
</li>
                                        <li>	The Body of the essay is where you develop your explanation and argument.  You may want to subdivide the essay using headings & subheadings or chapters to make it clearer. It is important to remember that you are constructing an argument not describing a situation.  Each paragraph should contain a point that contributes to your argument, the evidence that backs up your point and some explanation of the evidence (Point, Evidence, Explanation).<br />

You also need to evaluate your evidence.   There may be 2 contrasting views – to describe them both does not gain you marks, you need to explain which view you find most convincing and why. 
</li>
										<li>The conclusion sums up your argument and explains how it relates to your question.  There should not be anything that is not substantiated by the evidence you have already presented, and you should not include any new points, although you may want to put your topic into a wider context to show its importance, or indicate that there are unresolved issues / unanswered questions. </li>
                                        <li>In-Text Citations, Footnotes (or Endnotes) and the Bibliography provide the academic proof that you have not made the contents of your paper up.  They allow other people to check your evidence and ensure you have not taken details out of context or twisted the evidence.  You should aim to have used a range of sources rather than relying on just a few books (even if they are brilliant), and nothing should be included in the bibliography that you have not referred to in your paper.  Internet sites should not be your main sources.</li>
                                        <li>Note: Whether you use In-text parenthetical citations + a bibliography OR footnotes + a bibliography is determined by the documentation style you are using. It is not your personal choice! The school requires MLA documentation style unless another style is required by your subject.

                                        <li>Illustrations, maps, diagrams, photographs etc. can be very useful but should only be included if you refer to them directly in your essay.  In the same way, additional details in an appendix must not contain anything vital to your essay (the examiner does not have to read an appendix) and should only be included if you have referred to it in your essay, e.g. a map, a cartoon, a photograph or copy of primary source, a transcript of an interview.   All illustrations etc. must be clearly captioned (and annotated if relevant) and referenced.</li>

                                    <p>This is your own personal enquiry and you use the information you research to form your own conclusions.  You need to support your comments with references to your research and all direct and indirect use of sources should be acknowledged according to the documentation style you are using (e.g. MLA). However, heavy use of quotations will not score highly because you are not demonstrating the qualities of analytical thought and evaluation.  If you present other people’s work as your own ideas or research, without acknowledging the source, this is plagiarism – it is regarded as cheating and will invalidate your essay.</p>
                                    <p>Furthermore, if you re-produce your own work in your EE without acknowledgement, it is the equivalent of cheating and plagiarizing your own work. For example, if you have used any of the information/ideas in your EE in another essay or Internal Assessment, or your mini-EE, you must acknowledge that in your paper. </p>
                                    <p>Your supervisor has to sign a declaration that your paper is 100% your own work.  This can be done because your meetings and discussion of your progress are a way of ensuring you are reading the works for yourself and not relying on textbook summaries.  Your supervisor will also conduct a final interview where they question you about your sources and your conclusions.  The school also uses “Turnitin.com” which checks for plagiarism.</p>

                                    <p>You should expect to be listing at least 10 items in your bibliography, but remember these are academic works you have consulted – you do not need to read the whole book.  You should use the contents page and index to identify which sections are relevant for your enquiry.  Aim to use a range of works even if you find one book that seems to give you everything; you will be penalised if your references and bibliography are based on a small selection of sources.</p>
                                    <p>The Bibliography is an alphabetical list of all the sources you have used. The bibliography must be formatted according to the documentation style you are using for the entire paper. Please discuss this with your supervisor and look up the appropriate formatting guidelines in a reliable online source. Purdue’s Online Writing Lab is very useful. Here is the link for the bibliography (or works cited) according to the MLA guidelines: <a href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/05/" target="_blank">https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/05/</a></p>
                                    <p>Hint: Many university websites have excellent resources on various documentation styles.</p>
                                    <p>Note: For web sources - although MLA and other styles do not require the full web address, the IB does require the complete URL in your bibliography. </p>
                                    <p><strong>Parenthetical In-text Citations</strong></p>
                                    <p>n MLA style, referring to the works of others in your text is done by using what is known as parenthetical citation. This method involves placing relevant source information in parentheses after a quote or a paraphrase.

                                    <p><strong>Footnotes and Endnotes</strong></p>
                                    <p>Footnotes and endnotes are not included in your word count.  </p>
                                    <p>Depending on the documentation style you are using, footnotes may serve different purposes. In MLA, a footnote or endnote can be bibliographic notes, which refer to other publications your readers may consult. For example:</p>
                                    <div class="well">  
                                        <small>1. See Blackmur, especially chapters 3 and 4, for an insightful analysis of this trend.</small>
                                    </div>
                                    <p>This is NOT the bibliographic information for something you are quoting or citing. MLA uses in-text parenthetical referencing.  You can also use endnotes/footnotes for occasional explanatory notes (also known as content notes), which refers to brief additional information that might be too digressive for the main text. For example:</p>
                                    <div class="well">  
                                        <small>4. In a 1998 interview, she reiterated this point even more strongly: "I am an artist, not a politician!" (Weller 124).</small>
                                    </div>
                                    <p>Other documentation styles use footnotes and endnotes to provide the bibliographic information of a source you are using. If the reader wants to investigate that aspect of a topic further or just simply wants to check that your use of this point is valid, the footnote provides the directions for them to do so.  (Footnotes are given at the bottom of a page; endnotes can be given at the end of each chapter or all together at the end of the whole thing.) </p>
                                    <p>When and how to use a footnote or endnote is determined by the documentation style you are using. Study the guidelines before you start to write. </p>

                                    <p>The purpose of these criteria is to consider:</p>
                                    <ul>   
                                        <li><strong>A: Research Question: </strong>
Is the topic a suitable one considering the word limit and is the focus of the enquiry clear?  Depending on the subject, this does not have to be a question – the consideration of a hypothesis is also valid but the focus of the enquiry must be clear.<br /> 
The RQ must be stated in the introduction, in the abstract, and preferably on the title page.</li>
                                        <li><strong>B: Introduction:</strong> Your introduction should be brief. Does your introduction set the enquiry in its academic context  and show how it relates to existing knowledge on the topic? Does it explain why your RQ is significant and worthy of investigation? Does it clearly state the research question?<br />
This is assessed through the Introduction.
</li>
                                        <li><strong>C: Investigation: </strong>Do you show that you have consulted a range of suitable sources / gathered appropriate data and planned your investigation?  (This means have you planned the stages of your investigation, not have you planned the structure of your essay).  If your RQ is not suitable for systematic investigation the maximum you can score is 2.<br />
</li>
                                        <li><strong>D: Knowledge and Understanding: </strong>Do you show knowledge (through the facts you provide) and understanding (through your comments about these facts) and can you discuss different interpretations / explain the issues that are debated by academics?  If your RQ is not suitable for systematic investigation, the maximum you can score for this category is 2.<br />
This is assessed throughout the essay by the way you analyse and evaluate the information you use.
</li>
                                        <li><strong>E: Reasoned Argument:</strong> Have you planned and structured your essay to cover everything in a logical way in order to guide your reader through your argument?  Is your argument well presented to take into account different ideas and to explain why your conclusion is more convincing than other interpretations? (Instead of just presenting facts or telling the story).  Once again, if your RQ is not suitable for systematic investigation, the maximum you can score is 2.<br />
This is assessed throughout the essay by your overall approach, use of the sources, analysis and explanation.
</li>
                                        <li><strong>F: Application of Analytical and Evaluative Skills:</strong> Have you critically analysed and evaluated your information, using the correct techniques to evaluate the specific type of data and/or information you’ve included e.g. historical sources, assess a case study, report an experiment, interpret and analyse data in a table / graph, etc.?<br />
This is shown by the analytical comments you make about your research. 
</li>
                                        <li><strong>G: Use of Language Appropriate to the Subject:</strong>Is the essay written in formal academic language? Does it avoid the use of the 1st person? Are subject-specific words and terminology used correctly? This does not mean that you have to use very elaborate language. In fact, this could cause lack of clarity if you’re not used to this type of language. <br />
This will be assessed throughout the essay.
</li>
                                        <li><strong>H: Conclusion:</strong>Is the conclusion relevant to the research question and can it be substantiated by the evidence in the essay? Note: the conclusion is not the place to introduce a new piece of evidence or a new argument. <br /> 
This will be assessed in the conclusion in conjunction with the RQ, the overall argument and the use of evidence.

</li>
                                        <li><strong>I: Formal Presentation:</strong> Does your essay follow all of the rules for your documentation style (e.g. MLA)? Does the essay contain properly formatted title page (with all required elements), table of contents, page numbers, headings/subheadings, quotations, in-text citations (or footnotes/endnotes) and bibliography? Are images, graphs and tables formatted correctly? Have you double-spaced and used a legible 12-point font?<br />
     This will be assessed throughout the entire paper. 
</li>
                                        <li><strong>J: Abstract: </strong>Does the abstract state the Research Question clearly, explain how the investigation was carried out and what conclusions were reached?  Is it under 300 words?<br />
This is assessed in the abstract.
</li>
                                        <li><strong>K: Holistic Judgement:</strong> What features of your essay distinguishes it from the average essay?  (e.g. intellectual initiative, depth of understanding, insight, personal involvement).<br />
This is assessed throughout the paper in conjunction with the supervisor’s comments. 
</li>

													<li>If you are thinking of doing a science EE, please take the advice from your senior,
                                                    <p>“it is really time consuming and it requires great interests in this subject as well as huge responsibilities for conducting the experiment, which sometimes might be very boring.” (Fisher Wu 2013)</p>
                                                    </li>
													<li>The science EE must start working from mid Jan. The proposal must be approved during winter break and the investigation must begin after winter break. All data must be collected before June.</li>
                                                    </ul>
                                                    <p>Decide if you want to do an experimental or library-based EE.</p>
                                                    <ul>
                                                    <li>Experimental EEs: these tend to score better than the library-based EEs in Group 4. It is fairly easy to get data and then analyse it. But if you decide to measure something over time, you must do all this before the Extended Essay week which is intended for writing up. You have to work with the Science technicians in order to find time when you can use a laboratory to collect data while being supervised by a member of staff. Avoid experiments for which the outcome is already well documented.</li>
                                                    <li>Library-based EEs: A questionnaire, survey or a library-based topic in Group 4 may be easier to research (in school or at a University library) but you need to manage a large amount of material and be selective for relevant information.</li>
                                                    <li>If you intend to use laboratory outside school, you must get the agreement from the supervisor that he/she will be there most of the time to ensure that you are doing the experiment but no other parties.</li>
                                                    <li>For Biology EE, take note of the following guidelines:
                                                    <ol>
														<li>Experiment on plants over animals. No body fluid. If human is used as the subject, consent is needed and if below 18 yrs old, parent’s agreement is required.</li>
														<li>Experiment on commercial product is not a good idea.</li>
														<li>Get the raw material instead of using processed item. </li>
														<li>If the investigation is on animal, experiment with a slight adjustment on the nature condition is fine.</li>

                                        <li>Choose a topic and research question which is unique. This will allow you to show more personal judgement, and hence score more highly. If a website search engine turns up a lot of information about your exact topic, it is best to avoid it.</li>

                                    <p>You’re thinking about an English B Extended Essay? Cool! There are a few things you need to know about an English B EE, or should I say an English “BEE”, before deciding if it’s the right choice for you.
Who qualifies?</p>
                                    <p>If you’re studying English as your Group 1 (Language A) course, you are NOT allowed to write an English “BEE”. If that’s you, stop reading now and fly off to see your English A teacher. </p>
                                    <p>All English B students qualify to apply. However, you have to complete a written proposal presenting your idea(s) to the English B Teacher Team. There is a specific format to follow for this and you can get that information from any English B teacher. Do not write your proposal without the guidance of the “English B EE Proposal Guidelines”. You must also talk with an English B teacher a few times to make sure you’re on track. The earlier you do this the better!</p>
                                    <p><strong>The 3 Categories</strong></p>
                                    <p>There is a considerable amount of freedom given to students when choosing to write an English “BEE”. It’s a great opportunity to be creative and original, BUT you MUST fit your idea into one of three categories. </p>
									<p><strong>Cat 1 – Language</strong></p>
                                    <p>The essay should be a specific analysis of the language (its use, structure and so on) normally related to its cultural context or a specific text.</p>

                                    <p><strong>2B: Essays of a general cultural nature based on specific cultural artifacts</strong></p>
                                    <p>The essay should be an analysis of a more general cultural nature but specific to a country or community where English is spoken. Topics that are too broad and could apply to many cultures (like globalization, the death penalty or eating disorders) are inappropriate.
Essays of a cultural nature must be based on specific cultural artifacts. Cultural artifacts in this context are understood to include a wide variety of phenomena, such as works of fine art, newspapers, magazines, cartoons, films, television programmes and popular music. (If you’re wondering if something could be considered a “cultural artifact”, please talk to one of the English B teachers.)</p>

                                    <p><strong>What is a research journal?</strong></p>
                                    <p>A research journal is a notebook where you keep an accurate record of the research you’ve done and your ideas for further research. </p>
                                    <p><strong>What should it include?</strong></p>
                                    <p>Key Words List – A list of the key words and phrases which you’ll use in your online and library searches. You should review this list of key words and phrases with your EE Supervisor. </p>
                                    <p>Record of Sources Found – As you find useful sources of information, you need to keep track of these discoveries. Don’t just trust your memory! A good way to do this is by first categorizing the information you’ve found. Does it link to a particular aspect of your topic? Second, you should write all of the information you will need for future use in the bibliography. What’s the name/title of the source, publisher, page number, date accessed (for online source) etc? If you don’t do this, you’ll waste countless hours when trying to write your essay. </p>
                                    <p>Analysis of Sources – Of course, in addition to keeping track of useful information, you also need to analyze the information that you find and figure out if and how it fits into your EE. How does it link to your RQ? How does it connect to your argument? Does it support your argument or disagree with your argument?  (It’s a good idea to find differing opinions and evaluate them through your own analysis.) </p>
                                    <p>Random Ideas and Questions – You’ll soon realize that your EE seems to always be in the back of your mind. You may be riding the metro or sitting in math class when a great idea will suddenly pop into your head. Later that day, when you’re ready to work on your EE, you’ll think back to that moment and wrack your brain trying to remember your earlier brilliant idea, only to discover you’ve forgotten. Don’t let that happen to you! Anytime and anywhere, always have your RJ with you. When you get a great idea or a question pops into your head, just take out your notebook and quickly write it down in a section titled “Random Ideas and Questions”. You’ll be thankful for this! </p>
                                    <p>To do list  - Based on your ideas and questions, discussions with your supervisor, deadlines etc, you’ll need to maintain a ‘to do’ list. It might be a good idea to also transfer important deadlines and reminders to your calendar (student agenda book or an online calendar such as Google Calendar).</p>
                                    <p>Supervisor Meeting Notes – You’ll be meeting with your supervisor many times over the next few months. You must come prepared for these meetings with questions and/or objectives. These questions should be written in your notebook. As you discuss things with your supervisor, make note of important points and advice. Don’t just trust your memory! Write it down! Failing to make notes will result in you not following through on certain things, and that wastes both your time and your supervisor’s time. We’re all too busy for that!  Always bring your RJ to meetings with your supervisor. </p>
                                    <p>Reflection – One of the most important things you must do throughout the research and writing process is think and reflect on what you’re learning. This is a key part of analysis. You should regularly review the notes in your research journal. During this time, you’ll make connections, think of important questions, identify areas of weakness in your argument, and so on. You should then summarize those reflections in a section of your research journal called “Reflections”.  Much of what you write about in your reflection will eventually make its way into the body of your essay, so: you will essentially be writing the essay as you go if you keep your journal up to date!</p>
                                    <p>Everyone has a slightly different organization style. How you organize your RJ is largely up to you, however, please be sure to include all of the parts listed above.  Some people find it helpful to use tabs to separate sections, colour coding to show connections etc. Discover what works for you! These are habits which will stick with you throughout your academic life. </p>

                                    <p><strong>E-Research Journal</strong></p>
                                    <br />
                                    <p>ince some of your research will be done online (using JSTOR, Questia School or a search engine), it may be helpful to keep some parts of your journal in an electronic format. For example, if you plan to use a direct quote, it makes sense to copy and paste it directly from the source into your digital e-RJ. This will prevent you from making any mistakes when typing. You should still keep a record of the source in the notebook version of your RJ. Your e-RJ can simply be a word document.</p>
                                    <p>Note: Your supervisor has to sign off on the authenticity of your work. That is, your supervisor must feel completely comfortable stating that your EE is really and truly your own work. By reviewing your research journal, your supervisor will be able to follow your research and writing process, and will have no problem verifying the authenticity of your paper.</p>

                                    <p><strong>First: read the source you have selected</strong></p>

                                    	<li>Decide whether or not it contains information you think is relevant to your argument.</li>

                                    <p>A contents page must be provided at the beginning of the extended essay and all pages should be numbered. Please note that an index page is not required and if included will be treated as if it is not present.</p>
                                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                                    <p>The introduction should tell the reader what to expect in the essay. The introduction should make clear to the reader the focus of the essay, the scope of the research, in particular an indication of the sources to be used, and an insight into the line of argument to be taken.</p>
									<p>While students should have a sense of the direction and key focus of their essay, it is sometimes advisable to finalize the introduction once the body of the essay is complete.</p>
                                    <h3>Body of the essay (research, analysis, discussion and evaluation)</h3>
                                    <p>The main task is writing the body of the essay, which should be presented in the form of a reasoned argument. The form of this varies with the subject of the essay but as the argument develops it should be clear to the reader what relevant evidence has been discovered, where/how it has been discovered and how it supports the argument. In some subjects, for example, the sciences, sub-headings within the main body of the essay will help the reader to understand the argument (and will also help the student
to keep on track). In structuring their extended essay, students must take into consideration the expected conventions of the subject in which their extended essay is registered.</p>
									<p>Once the main body of the essay is complete, it is possible to finalize the introduction (which tells the reader what to expect) and the conclusion (which says what has been achieved, including notes of any limitations and any questions that have not been resolved).</p>
                                    <p>Any information that is important to the argument must not be included in appendices or footnotes/ endnotes. The examiner will not read notes or appendices, so an essay that is not complete in itself will be compromised across the assessment criteria.</p>
                                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                                    <p>The conclusion says what has been achieved, including notes of any limitations and any questions that have not been resolved. While students might draw conclusions throughout the essay based on their findings, it is important that there is a final, summative conclusion at the end. This conclusion(s) must relate to the research question posed.</p>
                                    <h3>References and bibliography</h3>
                                    <p>Students should use their chosen style of academic referencing as soon as they start writing. That way they are less likely to forget to include a citation. It is also easier than trying to add references at a later stage. For more information on this, refer to the guidelines in the IB document Effective citing and referencing.</p>
                                    <p>Writing the essay takes time but if students have used their Researcher's reflection space and reflection sessions in a meaningful way they should be well prepared to develop their arguments.</p>

                                    <p>The extended essay should be written in a clear, correct and formal academic style, appropriate to the subject from which the topic is drawn. Given that the extended essay is a formally written research paper, it should strive to maintain a professional, academic look.</p>
                                    <p>To help achieve this, the following formatting is required:</p>                                   
                                    
                                    <ul>
                                        <li> the use of 12-point, readable font</li>
                                        <li> double spacing</li>
                                        <li> page numbering</li>
                                        <li> no candidate or school name on the title page or page headers.</li>
                                        
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Submitting the extended essay in the required format will help set the tone of the essay and will aid readability for on-screen assessment by examiners.</p>
                                    <h3>Word counts</h3>
                                    <p>The upper limit is 4,000 words for all extended essays.</p>
                                    <p>Please note: Examiners are instructed not to read or assess any material in excess of the word limit. This means that essays containing more than 4,000 words will be compromised across all assessment criteria. Given the holistic nature of the assessment criteria, students who write in excess of the word limit will self- penalize across all criteria. For example, in criterion B, any knowledge and understanding demonstrated beyond the 4,000-word limit will be treated as if it were not present; in criterion C, analysis, discussion or evaluation made beyond the 4,000-word limit will be treated as if the point had not been made.</p>
                                    <p>Supervisors and students should be aware that the e-upload of extended essays will facilitate the automatic recognition of a cut-off point for assessment. Students should ensure that they remain within the word limit and should edit accordingly.</p>

                                    <p>Please refer to the document entitled Diploma Programme assessment: Principles and practice for further clarification of word count requirements.</p>
                                 
                                    <p>A note for students writing in Chinese and Japanese:</p>
									<p>While students should have a sense of the direction and key focus of their essay, it is sometimes advisable to finalize the introduction once the body of the essay is complete.</p>
                                   
                                    <p>Students writing their extended essay in Japanese or Chinese should use the following conversions.</p>
                                    <ul>
                                    	<li>Japanese: 1 word = approximately 2 Japanese characters (upper limit 8,000 characters)</li>
                                        <li>Chinese: 1 word = approximately 1.2 Chinese characters (upper limit 4,800 characters)</li>
                                    </ul>
									<p>When typing in Chinese, word processing software is likely to include the number of characters and punctuation in the word count. Students are asked to not include punctuation in the word count for assessed work. The word count should only take into account the number of characters typed.</p>
                                    <h3>Illustrations</h3>
                                    <p>Presentation and overall neatness are important, and it is essential that illustrative material, if included, is well set out and used effectively. Graphs, diagrams, tables and maps are effective only if they are clearly labelled and can be interpreted with ease.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Any labelling should contain the minimum information to ensure the examiner understands the significance of the map, chart, diagram or illustration. It must not include commentary, as this will be considered as part of the essay discussion and thus included in the word count.</p>
                                   
                                    <p>All such material that is incorporated into the extended essay must be directly related to the text and acknowledged where appropriate. The use of photographs and other images is acceptable only if they are captioned and/or annotated and are used to illustrate a specific point made in the extended essay. Students should be advised to use illustrations with caution as excessive use may detract from the discussion in the essay. They should only be used if they are relevant and appropriate to a point being made as part of the argument of the essay.</p>
                                    <h3>Tables</h3>
                                    <p>The use of tables should be considered carefully and are only really appropriate in certain subjects. Tables must not be used in an attempt to circumvent the word limit.</p>
                                    <h3>Footnotes and endnotes</h3>
                                    <p>Footnotes and endnotes may be used for referencing purposes and if this is the case will not be included in the word count of the essay. If information is contained in a footnote or endnote and is not a reference, this must be included in the word count. In order to avoid confusion and unwittingly exceed the word limit, students are advised to avoid using footnotes or endnotes other than for referencing purposes unless it is appropriate.</p>
                                    <p>As footnotes and endnotes are not an essential part of the extended essay students must take care to ensure that all information with direct relevance to the analysis, discussion and evaluation of their essay is contained in the main body of it.</p>
                                    <p>An essay that attempts to evade the word limit by including important material in footnotes or endnotes will be compromised across the assessment criteria. Please note that footnotes and endnotes are added to the word count as they are encountered.</p>
                                    <h3>Appendices</h3>
                                    <p>Appendices are not an essential part of the extended essay and examiners will not read them, or use any information contained within them, in the assessment of the essay. Students must take care to ensure that all information with direct relevance to the analysis, discussion and evaluation of their essay is contained in the main body of it. Appendices should therefore be avoided except in the following instances:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                    	<li>an exemplar of a questionnaire or interview questions</li>
                                        <li>an exemplar of permission letters</li>
                                        <li>group 1, category 1 essays: copies of poems or short stories (of less than three pages)</li>
                                        <li>group 1, category 3 essays: excerpts from newspapers, advertisements and transcripts of speeches</li>
                                        <li> language acquisition, category 1 and 2: excerpts from newspapers, advertisements, transcripts of speeches, etc</li>
                                        <li> language acquisition, category 3: excerpts or copies of poems or short stories (less than 3 pages)</li>
                                        <li>an external mentor letter, where one has been used</li>
                                        <li> raw data or statistical tables for experimental sciences (this should not include any analysis or conclusions).</li>
                                       
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Students should not continually refer to material presented in an appendix as this may disrupt the continuity of the essay and examiners are not required to refer to them.</p>
                                    <h3>Reliance on external resources</h3>
                                    <p>Irrespective of the subject, the extended essay should be a complete piece of independent research, modelled on an academic journal/research paper, which can exist and be understood on its own, without the need to access external links, such as hyperlinks, or accompanying material such as DVDs.</p>
                                    <p>Examiners will not access any material contained in an external source when assessing an essay. Material that is pertinent to the argument being made must be contained in the essay itself to be considered by examiners in their assessment of it.</p>
                                    <p>As with appendices, if information central to the argument is included in the external link, it is treated as though the point has not been made and as such could affect different criteria, for example, criterion C (critical thinking), depending on the quality of the other analyses.</p>
                                    <h3>Specimen materials</h3>
                                    <p>Specimen materials used in, or produced by, investigations do not form part of the extended essay and must not be submitted. Photographic evidence may be submitted in place of such material.</p>

                                    <p>I have discussed the extended essay process with my supervisor and have read the EE timeline.  I am aware of the time commitment.  My supervisor will inform me if I am falling behind.  If I do not rectify this then my supervisor will inform my tutor and parents.  I am also aware of the school policy on academic honesty and realise that the essay must be my own original work.</p>
